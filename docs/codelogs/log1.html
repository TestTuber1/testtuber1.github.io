    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <h2>What are Semantic Tags?</h2>

    <p>
        Semantic tags are tags that affect the webpage. They alter and style the page depending on their uses, and their names define what they do. Examples include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>&lt;head&gt; - container of title tag</li>
        <li>&lt;title&gt; - makes text the headline of the page</li>
        <li>&lt;h1&gt; - styles text to header 1 settings</li>
        <li>&lt;p&gt; - styles text to paragraph settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What are Non-Semantic Tags?</h2>

    <p>
        Non semantic tags do not directly affect the webpage, they can however if they are paired up with CSS. Even without CSS they prove to be helpful when it comes to code readability.

        <p><div class="header">
        <h1>This is section uses a header and can seperate that from the rest of your code</h1>
        </div>
    </textarea>

    <h2>Benefits of Semantic Tags</h2>

    <p>
        As semantic tags can manipulate web pages on their own, this provides key benefits. They make it easier for users to read and navigate web pages, otherwise web pages could just be giant blocks of text. Not only does ease of access benefit users too, but also the developers themselves as it makes it easier for search engines to understand the webpage and better spread it to people. There’s more benefits than that, but with all the information presented it's surely not too early to say that semantic tags are more useful than non-semantic tags, although that’s not to say non-semantic tags are useless.
